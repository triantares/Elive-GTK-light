This fancy-menus folder contains configuration options and paths to icons for inside ~/.e16/menus/
Normally that e16 menu gets regenerated everytime e16 does a new start after reboot and I have yet to find a way to get 2 spaces *consistently* (see issues) between my icons and the text in the menus.
When generating this menu,
Some entries are of course dependent on whether the application is installed or not.
For personal usage/installation copy the content to ~/.e16/menus/ or run the "install.sh" file. Running the "install.sh" will let you use this configuration until you logout and login again.
For persistent usage take the "y" option when prompted. If nothing is chosen the install will not do anything.
